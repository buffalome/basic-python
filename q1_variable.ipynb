        "## Introduction\n",
        "In computer programming, variables act as containers that store data in a program. They allow for easy management of information throughout a program's run. Python uses a system called dynamic typing, which figures out the type of data in a variable based on what is stored in it. This feature helps make Python easy for new programmers to learn.\n",

        "## Variable Naming Rules\n",
        "\n",
        "When creating variables in Python, certain naming rules must be followed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The first character must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
        "2. After the first character, the name can include letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
        "3. Variable names are case-sensitive. This means `age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three different variables.\n",
        "4. Python keywords, which are special words used by Python, cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Examples of valid variable names:** `name`, `age`, `student_count`, `_private_var`, `total2`\n",
        "- **Examples of invalid variable names:** `2total` (starts with a number), `my-var` (has a hyphen), `for` (Python keyword)\n",
        "\n",
        "While Python allows variables to start with an underscore, this is generally avoided unless there's a specific reason to do so.\n",
